Gaussian-ISP-model
===

Code estimating the parameters of a reverberation model with a fraquency dependent exponential decay, as described in [Stochastic reverberation model with a frequency dependent attenuation"_, WASPAA 2021].

Requirements
-------------
  - **Python 3**
  - **numpy** version >= 1.16
  - **scipy** version >= 1.2.1
  - **wavio** version >= 0.0.4 (only for the notebook, available on pip)

How to use
-------------
  See notebook **example.ipynb** for an example run of the EM algorithm or **help(EM)** for documentation of the module.

Example datasets
-------------
  In **P_matrix_model/saves**, example EM estimations can be found in pickle format. They can be loaded with the function EM.load_algo(filename) to recover an object of class EM.EM, including the original RIR EM.h and the learned parameters, and the sampling frequency of the original RIR.
  
  RIRs from three datasets are available:
  - Roomsimove: RIRs generated by Roomsimove [1] as described in the article,
  - MARDY: RIRs from the Mardy database recorded in a recording room (
  - QMUL: RIRs from the QMUL database recorded in a classroom as sampling frequency 96kHz.
